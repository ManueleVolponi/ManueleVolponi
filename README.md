## 💡 What I build
I design and ship backend systems, search engines, and full-stack platforms focused on performance, reliability, and developer experience. I’ve built production services using Python (Django/Flask), Redis, Celery, Postgres, MongoDB, MySQL, PHP and modern frontends in Vue/TypeScript.

## 🧠 Recent Highlights

### 🔍 Semantic + Keyword Search Engine
- Built a hybrid search engine for a recruitment platform that scans **page titles, FAQ entries, and user “keys of interest.”**  
- Combined **JSON-based in-memory search** (Binary Search + Boyer-Moore algorithm) for instant keyword lookup with **ElasticSearch + embeddings** for semantic filtering and ranking.  
- Delivered low-latency, high-accuracy matching between job posts and candidate profiles.

### ⚡ Real-Time Notification System
- Engineered a **Redis Pub/Sub + WebSocket + Celery** pipeline for instant, asynchronous messaging.  
- Supported push notifications for candidate updates and recruiter dashboards with millisecond-level delivery.  
- Deployed fault-tolerant workers, background queues, and graceful reconnection logic.
